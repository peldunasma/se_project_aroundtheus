# Project 3: Around The U.S.
This is the third project for Web Development program at Triple Ten. The project is about creating a responsive website to adapt to different screen dimensions (i.e. 1280px, 800px, 320px). A Figma example was used for comparisons to creating the different layouts. 

### Project features

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
