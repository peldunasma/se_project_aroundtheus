# Project 3: Around The U.S.
This is the third project for Web Development program at Triple Ten. For this project we had to create a responsive website to adapt to different screen dimensions (i.e. 1280px, 800px, 320px).As well as creating features to edit the profile, add new cards and activate the like buttons. A Figma layout was used for comparison to creating the different layouts.

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
